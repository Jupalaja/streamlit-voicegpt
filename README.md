# AI Assistant using OpenAI and Streamlit

This repository contains a Python script that creates an AI assistant using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model and Streamlit library. The assistant responds to user input in real-time and provides helpful answers.

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) (version 3.10 recommended) needs to be installed.


## Clone the Repository

To clone this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

------------
## Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other installed Python libraries. To create a virtual environment called `venv`, run the following command in your terminal:

```
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

This will create a virtual environment named `venv` in your current directory. 

## Activate the virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Required Libraries

To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the AI Assistant

To run the AI assistant, execute the following command in your terminal:
```
streamlit run chatgpt-whisper-streamlit.py
```

This will start the Streamlit application and open the AI assistant in your browser.
